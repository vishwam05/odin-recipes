    <h2> Ingridients: </h2>
        <h3> Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Toppings: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl,
                <p>then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes.
                <p>Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.
            </li>
            <li><p>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><p>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive <p>oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours.<p>Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.
            </li>
            <li><p>Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</li>
            <li><p>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C).<p>Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.</li>
            <li><p>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until <p>about 14 inches in diameter, or about the <p>size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.</li>
            <li><p>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon <p> pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 <p> cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty <p>areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.</li>
            <li><p>With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel easily. Place the<p> tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, <p>and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.</li>
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li><p>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface.<p>Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.</li>
        </ol>
